A PowerShell script that runs as a job and queries the Microsoft Office 365 URLs and IPs REST API for changes.  If changes are detected the script dumps the URLs and IPs in various formats (JSON, Text, etc.), creates a proxy autoconfiguration file (PAC), and sends mail notifcation that they have changed.  Useful for making sure organizations have awareness on the changes Microsoft makes.
